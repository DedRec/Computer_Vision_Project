# Computer_Vision_Project

In this project, we’ll do computer vision for robotics. 
We are going to build a Sample & Return Rover in 
simulation. Mainly, we’ll control the robot from images 
streamed from a camera mounted on the robot. The 
project aims to do autonomous mapping and 
navigation given an initial map of the environment. 
Realistically speaking, the hard work is done now that 
you have the mapping component! You will have the 
option to choose whether to send orders like the 
throttle, brake, and steering with each new image the 
rover's camera produces
